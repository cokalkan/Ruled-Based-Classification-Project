# Ruled-Based-Classification-Project
Identifying level based personas for customers, and calculating potential average revenue for a new customer

# Business Problem : 
Gezinomi aims to create level-based new sales definitions
by utilizing certain characteristics of its sales and, based on these new sales
definitions, wants to create segments and estimate how much potential
new customers could contribute to the company on average.
For example, determining how much an average customer,
who wants to visit an all-inclusive hotel in Antalya during a busy period,
could contribute."

# Dataset: 
The dataset 'gezinomi_miuul.xlsx' contains the prices and information
related to the sales made by the Gezinomi company. The dataset is composed of
records generated for each sales transaction. This implies that the table is
not deduplicated, in other words, a customer may have made multiple purchases.

# Objective:
Classify new incoming customers and predict how much revenue they could generate.

Example 1 : How much revenue is expected from a person who wants to have an all-inclusive vacation during the high season in Antalya? 
Example 2 : In the case of a holidaymaker going to a half-board hotel in Girne during the low season, which segment will they fall into?
